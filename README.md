# Project 4: O-Marche
#### Development Team: Amadou Tall, Eric Mathias

---
#### **Introduction:**

O-Marche is a web application designed to support farmers in connecting with their communities. Users can find local farmers markets and purchase local produce. The app provides farmers with the ability to create a store to showcase their products and provides communities with geo-location-based recommendations for local farmers markets. As the landscape of food growth and distribution is changing, users may need greater support in finding the food they wish to have!

They will be offered a map indicating their location along with 3 recommendations for farmers markets in their vicinity as provided by a geo-location API. The farmers with whom they will connect can create their store, showcase their products and make sales on the site.
